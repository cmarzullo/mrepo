# 0.6.0

* httpd gets configured
* extra options added to mrepo.conf. If you are getting started with mrepo there are some good ways to speed it up by using a reposync uri. You can also tweak the settings for more efficient caching.
* downloads and installs mrepo from git hub. You'll need git installed. I've chosen to use the opscode omnibus cookbook to setup the build environment
* cron support added

# 0.5.3

* It works!
* mrepo gets installed
* there is an repository provider for /etc/mrepo.conf.d files
* Not all mrepo options are supported. Just need to code them in.
